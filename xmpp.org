* Getting to Know XMPP (The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)

- Like HTTP, XMPP is a client-server protocol, but it differs from
  HTTP by allowing either side to send data to the other
  asynchronously. XMPP connections are long lived, and data is pushed
  instead of pulled.

** WhAt is XMPP?
- XMPP, like all protocols, defines a format for moving data between
  two or more communicating entities
- XML is known primarily as a document format, but in XMPP, XML data
  is organized as a pair of streams, one stream for each direction of
  communication. Each XML stream consists of an opening element,
  followed by XMPP stanzas and other top-level elements, and then a
  closing element. Each XMPP stanza is a first-level child element
  of the stream with all its descendent elements and attributes. At
  the end of an XMPP connection, the two streams form a pair of valid
  XML documents.


** XMPP Network
***  Servers
- XMPP servers, or more accurately, XMPP entities speaking the
  server-to-server protocol or the server end of the client-to-server
  protocol, are the circulatory system of any XMPP network. A serverâ€™s
  job is to route stanzas, whether they are internal from one user to
  another or from a local user to a user on a remote server.
- The set of XMPP servers that can mutually communicate forms an XMPP
  network.
- The set of public XMPP servers forms the global, federated XMPP
  network. If a server does not speak the server-to- server protocol,
  it becomes an island, unable to communicate with external servers.
