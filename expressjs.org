* Middleware
- In contrast to vanilla Node, where your requests flow through only
  one function, Express has a middleware stack, which is effectively
  an array of functions.

- Note that middleware sometimes continues on but sometimes responds
  to requests.
- Each middleware function can modify the request or the response, but
  it doesnâ€™t always have to. Eventually, some middleware should
  respond to the request. It could be the first one; it could be the
  last. If none of them respond, then the server will hang and the
  browser will sit alone, without a response.

- When a request comes in, it will always go through the middleware in
  the same order in which you use them.

* Routing
- Routing is a lot like middleware, but the functions are called only
  when you visit a specific URL with a specific HTTP method. For
  example, you could only run a request handler when the browser
  visits yourwebsite.com/about.
