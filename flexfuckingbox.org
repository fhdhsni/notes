- =justify-content= used to distribute space on the main axis
- =align-items= used to align items on the cross axis, the defualt
  value is =stretch=. =align-items= doesn't control wrapped
  items. checkout =align-content= for controlling wrapped flex items
- =flex-grow= Used to specify the ratio of the space an item should
  fill in the main axis. It accepts numbers and the default is 0. 0
  means don't grow. The available space is all of the space of the
  container minus the space necessary for other flex items. NOTE:
  content with different widths will affect the ratio size
- =flex-shrink= Used to specify the "shrink factor" of a flex item. It
  accepts number and the *default is 1* which means do shrink.
- =flex-basis= used to specify the initial size of a flex item. It
  default to auto. In addition to accepting a length unit, =flex-basis=
  can take the keyword values of =content= and =auto=.
  A value of =content= means that the =flex-basis= is taken from
  the content size of the item in the main dimension.
  Then we have the very useful value of =auto=. Use =auto= as your
  =flex-basis= and, if you’ve set a =width= on the item, that =width=
  will be used as the =flex-basis= value. If you haven’t set a =width=,
  =auto= resolves to the content size.

- =align-self= Used to align individual flex items by overriding the
  =align-items= value. The default value is =stretch=.

- =align-content= Defines how each line is aligned within a flexbox
  container. It only applies if flex-wrap: wrap is present, and if
  there are multiple lines of flexbox items.
