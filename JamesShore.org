- Assume your code goin' to live for a long time

- You cannot predict how requirements gonna change in the future (Your
  desing needs to be able to accommodate these changes, even things you don't expect)

- When (not if) I need to change this design decision how hard will it
  be? (e.g not using JQuery anymore, or using someting else instead)

- Once & Only Once: Every concept in your system have one place for it
  and only one place. (have a spot for every important concept in your
  system)
