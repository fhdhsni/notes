Entity Relationship Diagram: This dude acts like a blueprint for our database.

There are five major parts to an =ERD=:

1. Entity:
  Represent a person, place or thing that you want to track at a database.
2. Attributes:
  Describes various characteristic about an individual entity.
  It doesn't have to be unique or something
3. Primary Keys:
  An attribute that uniquely identifies an entity. And when we need more
  than one attribute to uniquely identify an intance of our entity
  that's a composite key.
4. Relationship:
  Describes how one or more entities interact with each other
5. Cardinality:
  The count of instances that are allowed or are necessary between entity relationships.
  E.g. take a phone number entity, it must belong to someone. But
  someone may have zero, one or bizillion phone number.
  Cardinality is broken down to two parts: 
   1) Minimum Cardinality: Minimum number of instances that are
      required in the relationship. That is the fewest number of rows
      that we need for a relationship.
      
   1) Maximum Cardinality: Maximum number of instances that are
      allowed. We can exceed this number in our relationship
