- Flowcharts
  + Write states and instruction steps inside rectangles.
  + Write decision steps, where the process may go different ways, inside diamonds.
  + Never mix an instruction step with a decision step.
  + Connect sequential steps with arrows.
  + Mark the start and end of the process.

- Mathematical Models
  + A *model* is a set of concepts that represents a problem and its characteristics.

  + *Associativity*
    * Parentheses are irrelevant for sequences of =AND= or =OR=
      operations. As sequences of sums or multiplications in
      elementary algebra, they can be calculated in any order.
      #+BEGIN_SRC
          A AND (B AND C) = (A AND B) AND C
          A OR (B OR C) = (A OR B) OR C
      #+END_SRC
  + *Distributively*
    * In elementary algebra we factor multiplicative terms from sums:
      a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c). Likewise in logic, ANDing
      after an OR is equivalent to ORing results of ANDs, and vice
      versa:
      #+BEGIN_SRC
      A AND (B OR C) = (A AND B) OR (A AND C).
      A OR (B AND C) = (A OR B) AND (A OR C).
     #+END_SRC
  + *DeMorgan's Law*
    * It can’t be summer and winter at once, so it’s either not summer
      or not winter. And it’s not summer and not winter if and only if
      it’s not the case it’s either summer or winter. Following this
      reasoning, ANDs can be transformed into ORs and vice versa:
      #+BEGIN_SRC
      !(A AND B) = !A OR !B,
      !A AND !B = !(A OR B).
      #+END_SRC
