** Meridian
- A meridian (or line of longitude) is the half of an
  imaginary great circle on the Earth's surface, terminated by the
  North Pole and the South Pole, connecting points of equal longitude,
  as measured in angular degrees east or west of the Prime
  Meridian. The position of a point along the meridian is given by
  that longitude and its latitude, measured in angular degrees north
  or south of the Equator. Each meridian is perpendicular to all
  circles of latitude.

** Longitude (λ)
- 0 degree is called prime meridian
- going from north <-> south (so dividing the earth to west/east hemisphere)

** Latitude (φ)
- 0 degree is called equator
- going to from east <-> west (so dividing the earth to north/south hemisphere)

** timezones
- Earth is divided to 24 timezones, by 24 meridians (each 15 degree,
  that is to say earth rotates 15° per hour), each
  increasing/decreasing by 1 hour from prime meridian (0° Longitude)

- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC aka GMT) is not adjusted for
  daylight saving time
- USA
  + Pacific Time (PST) is -8 from UTC (Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles...)
  + Mountain Time (MST) is -7 from UTC (Denver, Phoenix...)
  + Central Time (CST) is -6 from UTC (Dallas, Chicago, Memphis, Minneapolis...)
  + Eastern Time (EST) is -5 from UTC (New York, Washington...)

** International Date Line
- the meridian 180° from prime meridian
- it's ± 12 hours from prime meridian (starting point of a new day)
