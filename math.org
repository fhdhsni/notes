* Principles Of Problem Solving

1. Understand the Problem
   - What is the unknown?
   - What are the given quantities?
   - What are the given conditions?
2. Think of a Plan
   Find a connection between the given information and the unknown that
   enables you to calculate the unknown.
   Ask yourself explicitly: “How can I relate the given to the unknown?”
   - *Try to Recognize Something Familiar*
   - *Try to Recognize Patterns*
   - *Use Analogy*: If you can solve the similar, simpler problem, then
     it might give you the clues you need to solve the original, more
     difficult one. For instance, if a problem involves very large
     numbers, you could first try a similar problem with smaller
     numbers. Or if the problem is in three-dimensional geometry, you
     could look for some- thing similar in two-dimensional
     geometry. Or if the problem you start with is a general one, you
     could first try a special case.
   - *Introduce Something Extra*: For instance, in a problem for which a
     diagram is useful, the auxiliary aid could be a new line drawn in
     the diagram.
   - *Take Cases*: You might sometimes have to split a problem into
     several cases and give a different argument for each case.
   - *Work Backward*
   - *Establish Subgoals*
   - *Indirect Reasoning*
   - *Mathematical Induction*: ??
3. Carry Out the Plan
4. Look Back: “Every problem that I solved became a rule which served
   afterwards to solve other problems.”
