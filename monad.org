Here I try to understand monad. From all over the Internet

- The term monad is a bit vacuous if you are not a mathematician. An
  alternative term is *computation builder* which is a bit more
  descriptive of what they are actually useful for.


* Functors
- A Functor is any data type that defines how =fmap= applies to it.
* Applicatives
- Applicatives take it to the next level. With an applicative, our
  values are wrapped in a context, just like Functors, but our
  functions are wrapped in a context too!
