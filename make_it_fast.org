* PWD
1. Web App Install banner
2. Splash Screen
3. Offline Support
4. Time to first paint
5. Time to first meaningful paint
6. Time to fisrt meaningful interaction
7. Responsive
8. Web App Manifest
9. SW (1. App Shell Skeleton (sw-precach?) 2.Content caching (sw-toolbox?))

*Design for constraint environments*

* PRPL or whatever

GOAL: 
1. Being interactive under 5 seconds on shitty devices with shitty network connection.
2. On 3G, it's 3 seconds.
3. On cable, under 1000 ms.
4. Repeat views (useing SW) as close to zero as possible.

** Push And Preload
1.
#+begin_src html
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//o.twimg.com">
#+end_src

2. 
#+begin_src html
<link rel=preload href="babolibaboli.boo/foo.js"
#+end_src

** Render
1. =Requestidlecallback=
scedule work when there's a free time at the end of a frame.

**   Precache
1. Sw
2. Application Shell (Or maybe ignore app shell and load the content first)
   - Inline critical CSS in =<head>=
   - Async load CSS/JS for current view. (e.g <link async ...>)

** Lazy-Load
