- As with <header>s and <footer>s (and all of the new elements),
you’re not restricted to one <nav> per page.

- “Sectioning content” includes article, aside, nav,
and section, and “sectioning root elements” are blockquote,
body, details, fieldset, figure, and td.)

- Note that certain elements—<blockquote>, <body>, <details>,
<fieldset>, <figure>, <td>—are said to be sectioning roots, and
can have their own outlines, but the sections and headings
inside these elements do not contribute to the outlines of their
ancestors.
