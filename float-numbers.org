* The idea is to compose a number of two main parts:

- A significand that contains the number’s digits. Negative
  significands represent negative numbers.
- An exponent that says where the decimal (or binary) point is placed
  relative to the beginning of the significand. Negative exponents
  represent numbers that are very small (i.e. close to zero).
- Scientific Notation: has a single digit to the left of the decimal point. 
- Can also represent binary numbers in scientific notation: 1.0 × 2-3 
- Computer arithmetic that supports such numbers is called Floating Point.
